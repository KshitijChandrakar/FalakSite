      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you serve the guests?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Can you bring them snacks from the kitchen?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Help me&#xA;clean the drawer quickly&amp;rdquo; are questions I have heard being asked exclusively to my sister&#xA;growing up.&#xA;She&amp;rsquo;s only three years older than me, so it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not because she’s better at these things than&#xA;I am.&#xA;I think the presence of ingrained patriarchy in almost every Indian household is so normalised&#xA;that it can be hard to recognise its existence. Perhaps it is because of generations of conditioning&#xA;that both men and women propagate such a mindset.&#xA;It promotes the idea that a certain gender is responsible for certain tasks and creates toxic gender&#xA;roles.&#xA;Although I know my family holds relatively progressive views and would never knowingly&#xA;discriminate based on gender, this same mindset, when reinforced, leads some men to feel a&#xA;sense of entitlement. The same sense of entitlement that makes them believe they have the right&#xA;to take liberties with women.&#xA;It makes them believe they have the right to climb over the walls of a university, harass female&#xA;students and shout sexist slogans.&#xA;It is important for men to engage in conversations about equality and feminism so that we can&#xA;create an inclusive society for all genders. The patriarchal mindset affects both men and women,&#xA;and overcoming it requires everyone&amp;rsquo;s contribution. This could be done by introducing gender&#xA;studies as a subject in school, by creating equal opportunities and responsibilities at home, and&#xA;by creating a safe space for open communication.&#xA;I am ashamed to share some of my stereotypically feminine interests, which has made me&#xA;hesitant to express myself freely, even in my own home. When I once asked my father to buy me&#xA;an embroidery kit, he laughed because he could not understand why a man would want to learn&#xA;such a thing.&#xA;I think if we truly want to achieve gender equality, we need to challenge the deeply rooted&#xA;patriarchal norms in our society. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to simply acknowledge their existence, we must&#xA;actively work to overcome them. This means challenging our own beliefs and behaviours, as&#xA;well as those of our family and community.&#xA;I have come to realise that it’s in my hands to redefine what it means to be a man in an Indian&#xA;household. I am the one who has to take the initiative to serve the guests or help clean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
