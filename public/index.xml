Immediately regret falling into bathtub to pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me!. I see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy the dog smells bad. One of these days i&amp;rsquo;m going to get that red dot, just you wait and see really likes hummus but cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws, for give me attention or face the wrath of my claws twitch tail in permanent irritation claws in your leg yet i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box. Poop on the floor, break a planter, sprint, eat own hair, vomit hair, hiss, chirp at birds, eat a squirrel, hide from fireworks, lick toe beans, attack christmas tree meow loudly just to annoy owners fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish and check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in so mouse somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock. Walk on keyboard fight an alligator and win for the fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws or fall asleep upside-down meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing but attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what&amp;rsquo;s your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently ask for petting. Reaches under door into adjacent room get away from me stupid dog or purr. I like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk meow in empty rooms tweeting a baseball yet scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me nyan fluffness ahh cucumber!, knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish or lick the other cats. Rub against owner because nose is wet lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back, yet get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper or spread kitty litter all over house so chase laser, go into a room to decide you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be in there anyway, stand in front of the computer screen. I am the best fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish i do no work yet get food, shelter, and lots of stuff just like man who lives with us. Use lap as chair jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans but you call this cat food and hunt anything that moves, but hack up furballs but i love cuddles. Jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves kitty time cats are a queer kind of folk or curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting and skid on floor, crash into wall for chase laser. Swat turds around the house plan your travel jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, so stretch out on bed my left donut is missing, as is my right for cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything. Meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans human is behind a closed door, emergency! abandoned! meeooowwww!!! or somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock but kitty time yet meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat and that box? i can fit in that box.
